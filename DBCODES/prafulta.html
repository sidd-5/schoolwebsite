                A formal assessment (Psycho educational assessment) will be conducted by an 'Educational Psychologist' to have the proper diagnosis of the exact difficulties being faced by the child.<br>
                Based on the above results, an IEP (Individualized Education Plan) is generated for a specific period of time (3 - 6 months).<br>
                An IEP is shared with the parents and teachers, to make the child's learning process more effective.<br>
                During this process, we take the help of 'Multi modal therapy', involving other therapists like Occupational therapists & Speech therapists.<br>
