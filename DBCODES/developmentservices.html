                We are guided by the Preventive System of St. John Bosco when we reach out to the under-served population by empowering them through participation and collective efforts to secure opportunities for their growth and social justice. <br><br> 
                Our activities include skill development classes for women and youngsters at Nerul and Belapur, Panvel and Vashi in Navi Mumbai, Mankhurd and Chembur in Mumbai. We help people obtain identity documents, referral services for entrepreneurship development among poor youth, promoting youth leadership and networking with local government and community groups to create a foundation for collective action. <br><br> 
                Girls and women tend to be employed as domestic maids. For the past 12 years, our Centre at Nerul has been training marginalized girls and women in myriad skills, in a bid to ensure the opening up of an income generating opportunities for their future employment.

it stocked with free cooked food <br>and bottled water so
that ‘anyone and everyone’ who is hungry can open it,
get a meal, without asking questions or losing their
self-respect.<br> It has helped serve the poor and needy
with meals during the lockdown. Till this day we serve
about 25 to 30 meals on a daily basis.

 organises meaningful social outreach programs to the migrant communities.
 The children of Don Bosco School Nerul along with their teachers go on field
 trips to these communities to understand first-hand the life of the people over
 there. These interactions not only benefit the community members who feel
 special with the students' visit but also leave a lasting impression on the
 students. The knowledge gained through these experiences will undoubtedly
 contribute to shaping them into responsible and compassionate individuals,
 equipped to contribute positively to society in the future.

 to empower Women through skilling. The program aims at
 equipping women with a trade so that they can

 Tailoring, Beautician, Mehandi and bag making.
 We have Facilities Management, Refrigerator, Washing
 Machine and Airconditioning repairs (RACW) program for
 the youth who can learn a skill that can give them
 employment. The programs are done both on campus and
 in each community. The classes are conducted by trained
 volunteers from within the community. The programs are
 supported by well known brands and NGO’s.

 restart their education and prepare for their examinations. Don Bosco Nerul is
 an Accredited Institute for Home Schooling. The open, flexible free classes for
 students of Standard X and XII under the NIOS is an initiative that has gained
 much popularity. Around 748 students have registered so far. We have
 students coming from Navi Mumbai, Panvel and Mumbai areas such as Cheeta
 Camp and Mankhurd. Our approach is not only academic excellence but also
 focusing on the personal development needs of the students preparing them
 for future endevours.

 remembrance, acknowledgement and awareness in the lives of members who

 provides them a chance to move beyond and widen their horizons. Be it
